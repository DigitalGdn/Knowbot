# Knowbot

## Examples

### Floating button

### Custom button

You can add your own link or button to your website header or page content.

Assign the class `.knowbot` to connect it to Knowbot.

We handle the logic but the styling of the button is up to you.

Alternatively, you can set the link to `#knowbot`.

### Both static and floating buttons
